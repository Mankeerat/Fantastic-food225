# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
    Our group will aim to meet at least once a week, with each meeting lasting at least an hour. We are going to try our best to meet in person 
    (at least until turkey break), and we will use zoom to meet over break. For zoom, we will record meetings, and for in person, we will document our progress 
    each time we meet, as well as write down goals we have for the group before the next time we meet as well. 
    
2. **Assistance** 
    We have created a group IMessage/SMS chat, and it is expected that any questions/ communication in that chat WILL be responded to within 24 hours. 
    This group chat is where we will set up times to meet every week as well, and get opinions on code that has been written, or documentation that has been recorded. 
    
3. **Respect** 
    We will make sure that every team member's ideas are heard. We will not interrupt others, or put others in our group down for any idea they have. 
    If we think that the idea could be better or improved, we will convey this is a noninsulting, but direct way. If we do not like someone else's idea, 
    or feel threatened by another idea in the group, we will also convey this is a clear, calm and concise way. It is easy to let ego get in the way of a coding project, 
    and our group has decided to avoid this by making sure that for every decision that is made along the way, that decision is discussed with each and every member of 
    the group, and each member is able to share their thoughts on it. We will also not change anything behind people's backs-- if we are going to change something in the 
    documentation or code, we will let the other people in the group know about it, especially if they had already worked on it. 

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 

5. **Time Commitment** 

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
    If there is a disagreement or conflict in the group, it will be DISCUSSED, and not blocked out. It will be discussed in a respectful and clear way, such that each 
    group member can clearly understand what the problem is, why it is happening and how to resolve it. If we need to reassign work, we will do it as a team. If we need 
    to change something in our project, we will do so, as a team. If we have a problem with people in our group, we will resolve this, AS A TEAM. In order to avoid 
    further conflicts (if one were to happen in the first place), we have decided that it would be best to not exclude people from a the conversation about the problem, 
    even if it doesn't directly involve them. This is how we would like our team to operate, and we believe that this will prevent any serious conflicts from developing, 
    as well as stifle any conflicts that do arise.
