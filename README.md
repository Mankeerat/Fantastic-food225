- To compile the program, simply navigate inside the "src" directory, and type "make" into terminal. 
- To run, type ./main to produce the output of main.cpp, which prints out the entire BTree, and runs tests on find, findAll, copy, =operator, traverse, 
    split-child, and our 3 algorithms that we were required to implement.
