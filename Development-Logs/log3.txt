# Development Log (Date: 11/11/22 -- 11/18/22)

## Weekly Goals
    - Get the BTree fully working, and implement a search algorithm for our Tree. 
    
## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
    - Mankeerat will finish processing the data set, and start running tests on the current BTree with our current operations on the larger set to iron out any bugs. 
    - David will fix bugs with "find" algorithms in the BTree class, and finish writing tests for all algorithms and methods written so far. Also fix bugs with copy 
        constructor and =operator.  
    - Jason will work on the split child feature of the BTree, which will be difficult, but essential to keeping our BTree Efficient. 
    - We will meet before the end of this week with either our mentor, or with the whole group to discuss meeting dates over break, 
        as well as tasks that we would like to 100% accomplish before we return.  
    
## Problems Encountered 
    - Encountered a couple bugs with find and =operator methods-- looking to fix these bugs by the end of the week, so we have all simple operations 
        done on the BTree before we start implementing the complete data set.
    - Also, we need to finalize whether we do BFS or DFS, and that will determine how we do split child. Likely it will be BFS, since it is a BTree, but 
        depending on how it is stored, it may be a super wide tree. 
    
## Plans for next week
    - Start implementing the remaining 2 algorithms on our Tree, and start creating a graph if needed out of it. 
    - Finish BFS/DFS and implement simple recommendations--> ALSO: fix all bugs with simple methods  
## Optional: Questions for mentor
