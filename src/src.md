Located in the SRC directory is:

    -Utils.h/cpp : contains functions that do not relate directly to the graph, but to other calculations
    - BFS method 
    - Dijkstra's Method
    - PageRank Method
    - main.cpp with basic tests for the graph, and main code for the program
    - tests.cpp contains all the more complex test cases for BFS, Dijkstra's, and pagerank

- To Run: "make" in terminal to compile, and "./main" to run
